					<h4>Objective</h4>
					<p>Match pairs of resource cards to unlock materials to grow your plant. Each sucessful match will contribute to your plan‚Äôt progress. But be careful, there are ‚Äúgrass‚Äù cards that don‚Äôt match, and they don‚Äôt help your plant grow!</p>

					<h4>How to play</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Flip any two cards at a time by clicking on them
						</li>
						<li>
							If the two cards match, you earn a resource to help your plant grow! Resources might include water, sunlight, or nutrients.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you flip over a "grass" card, it doesn‚Äôt have a match. It won‚Äôt help your plant, but don‚Äôt worry‚Äîyou can keep playing until you find the matching pairs.
						</li>
						<li>
							Each level requires a specific number of matches to unlock all the resources needed to complete a stage of your plant‚Äôs growth.
						</li>
					</ul>
