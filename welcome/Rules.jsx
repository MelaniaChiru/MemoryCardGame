                <h2>Welcome to Sprout Quest, a fun and engaging card-matching game where your memory and strategy help grow a beautiful plant!</h2>
                <h3>Objective:</h3>
                <p>Match pairs of resource cards to unlock materials needed to grow your plant. Each successful match will contribute to your plant's progress. But be carefulâ€”there are "dirt" cards that donâ€™t match, and they wonâ€™t help your plant grow!</p>
                <h3>How to Play:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Card Matching:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Flip over two cards at a time.</li>
                            <li>If the two cards match, you earn a resource to help your plant grow! Resources might include water, sunlight, or nutrients.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Dirt Cards:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you flip over a "dirt" card, it doesnâ€™t have a match. It wonâ€™t help your plant, but donâ€™t worryâ€”you can keep playing until you find the matching pairs.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Level Progression</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each level requires a specific number of matches to unlock all the resources needed to complete that stage of your plant's growth.</li>
                            <li>As you progress, the number of cards increases, and the challenge grows!</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Winning the Game:</li>
                        <ul>Complete all levels by finding the required matches and growing your plant to its full potential. Watch as it blossoms into something amazing with your hard work and focus!</ul>
                </ol>
                <h3>Tips for Success:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remember Card Positions: Try to remember where each card is to make matching faster. </li>
                        <li>Avoid Dirt Cards: While they donâ€™t harm your progress, flipping fewer dirt cards will save you time and effort.</li>
                    </ul>
