# üå± Sprout Quest 

Sprout Quest is a fun and engaging card-matching game where players use memory and strategy to grow a beautiful plant.
As you advance through levels, the number of cards increases, making the game more challenging.

## üöÄ Features
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Each level introduces more tiles, making it increasingly challenging to remember tile positions and find matches.
- **Visual Progression**: As you collect resources and complete levels, your plant grows visually, and the resource icons fill up every time a match is made.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- React.js (via CDN)
